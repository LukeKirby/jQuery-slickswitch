# SlickSwitch
A simple jQuery plugin to transform simple check boxes into stylish switches 

SlickSwitches is a low-footprint and thus environmentally friendly jQuery plugin that allows you to turn any ordinary boring checkbox on your page into a fantastically well-styled switch.
Since the switch takes the place of an ordinary checkbox, this jquery plugin degrades without an issue if JavaScript is not enabled. you can extend it with many possibilities.
SlickSwitch has got the following configurable options :-
* cssPrefix – Prefix of classes generated by slickswitch.
* useAnimation – When false switch is instant.
* toggled – Trigger a function when switch is toggled.
* toggledOn – Trigger a function when switch is switched on.
* toggledOff – Trigger a function when switch is switched off.

The original project appears to be inactive (last commit 2012) so I have added the project on github to make a few changes.
